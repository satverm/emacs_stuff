# This repo is for experimenting with emacs
  * Emacs is a beautiful program which you can use with windows or linux.
  * The program can be your goto text-editor to start with and for almost all your tasks if you further deep dive and have patience to learn the key 
  bindings.
  * This being one of the longest running program still under active development, must be tried atleast once.
